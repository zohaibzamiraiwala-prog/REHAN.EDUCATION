        <h1>Founder’s Message</h1>
        <p>Dear visitor,</p>
        <p>Thank you for your interest in Rehan School, my name is Rehan Allahwala, and I have been an entrepreneur most of my life, I have done over 150 businesses in 7 plus countries and failed in most of them, thus I claim to have a Ph.D. in failure. What I have learned is to keep trying and not be afraid of failure.</p>
        <p>Today humanity knows how to create Doctors, Engineers, Swimmers, and Cricketers, but we do not know how to create world-class leaders who bring change like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Edison, and Obama. The most important work in the world, we leave it to CHANCE and we do not have a process to create the next Steve jobs.</p>
        <p>We choose not to give a car to someone without training and license, we train people for years to become an accountant, a lawyer, and a doctor, but for a world leader, we leave it to chance, so NO MORE.</p>
        <p>I think there must be a way to make this happen, and we should not leave it to Chance or ACCIDENT for it to happen, and I Have set out to find, create, and implement a process so we can create a system that can help us MAKE the next Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.</p>
        <p>This is what this School is made for, It is an experimental school that will keep trying to make and find ways to create amazing future leaders in the world, who can fix the things that are broken around us that need desperate fixing.</p>
        <p>The world has amazing tools today like the Internet, AI, Computers, VR, and Mobiles, and the education system is slow to adopt these changes, We at Rehan School aim to use all these tools, use the First principal method, and re-engineer the education system.</p>
        <p>I aim to educate and create 1000 future leaders from my school, under my direct supervision, so that these students and future leaders can go out there, and make a better world for everyone, I am to create a Nobel laureate, Guinness World record holders, and multi-millionaires, who will be trained in doing so.</p>
        <p>If you think you want your child to become the next future leader in business and in the world of issues who will impact 10 million + Human beings positively, this is the school for you, but if you want a regular Joe with good numbers this is not the school for your child.</p>
        <p>I thank you for visiting us and allowing me to tell you my vision of how we can finally take care of the leadership failure in our countries and the world.</p>
